This repository contains a simple JavaScript example demonstrating proper error handling for division by zero. The `bug.js` file shows the initial code with a potential division by zero, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that includes error handling to gracefully manage this scenario, preventing unexpected program termination.  This example highlights best practices for writing more resilient and predictable JavaScript code.
